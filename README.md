# Instagram Clone

The goal of this project is to learn React & Typescript while recreating Instagram and most of its features. I plan on using the MERN stack to build this app.


All icons used in this project are from Google fonts.

## Current status
The navbar displays as intended <br>
Posts are mostly done on the front end. All thats left is to make the icons change when liked/saved<br>

## TODO
Installed express and some of the backend components<br>
Need to setup MongoDB (locally) connect that to the backend<br>
Need to plan out database model once I finish learning about MongoDB<br>
Need to connect the backend and frontend
