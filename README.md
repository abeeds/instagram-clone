# Instagram Clone

The goal of this project is to learn React & Typescript while recreating Instagram and most of its features. I plan on using the MERN stack to build this app.


All icons used in this project are from Google fonts.

## Current status
The navbar displays as intended <br>
posts are mostly done on the front end. All thats left is to make the icons change when liked/saved<br>
