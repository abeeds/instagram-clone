# Instagram Clone

The goal of this project is to learn React & Typescript while recreating Instagram and most of its features. I plan on using the MERN stack to build this app.


All icons used in this project are from Google fonts.

## Database Schemas
<ul>
    <li><strong>User</strong>: Username, Email, PhoneNum?, Birthday?, Bio, Gender?, </li>
    <li><strong>Following</strong>: Follower, Followed</li>
    <li><strong>Post</strong>: username, location?, date-posted, content, description, like_count=0, comment_count=0,  </li>
    <li><strong>Story</strong>: </li>
</ul>

## Current status
The navbar displays as intended <br>
Posts are mostly done on the front end. All thats left is to make the icons change when liked/saved<br>

## TODO
Installed express and some of the backend components<br>
Need to setup MongoDB (locally) connect that to the backend<br>
Need to plan out database model once I finish learning about MongoDB<br>
Need to connect the backend and frontend
